             who raises his children, Tom and Louisa, in a stifling and arid atmosphere of grim practicality.
             Without a moral compass to guide them, the children sink into lives of desperation and despair, played out against the grim
             background of Coketown, a wretched community shadowed by an industrial behemoth. Louisa falls into a loveless marriage with Josiah Bouderby,
             a vulgar banker, while the unscrupulous Tom, totally lacking in principle, becomes a thief who frames an innocent man for his crime.
             Witnessing the degradation and downfall of his children, Gradgrind realizes that his own misguided principles have ruined their lives.',

                an eccentric detective, a suspenseful courtroom drama, and a surprising, unusual solution.  Yet it is not a mystery novel.  Seething with the
                undercurrents of antebellum southern culture, the book is a savage indictment in which the real criminal is society, and racial prejudice
                 and slavery are the crimes.  Written in 1894, Pudd\'nhead Wilson glistens with characteristic Twain humor, with suspense, and with pointed irony:
